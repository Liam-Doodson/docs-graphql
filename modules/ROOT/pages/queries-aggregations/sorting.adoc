:description: This page describes how to use sorting input types.

A sorting input type is generated for every object type defined in your type definitions.
It allows for query results to be sorted by each individual field.

Using this example type definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie @node {
    title: String!
    runtime: Int!
}
----

The following sorting input type and query are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie @node {
    title: String!
    runtime: Int!
}

enum SortDirection {
    ASC
    DESC
}

input MovieSort {
    title: SortDirection
    runtime: SortDirection
}

type Query {
    movies(where: MovieWhere, sort: [MovieSort!], limit: Int, offset: Int): [Movie!]!
}
----

The following query fetches all movies sorted by runtime in ascending order:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies(sort: [
            {
                runtime: ASC
            }
        ]
    ) {
        title
        runtime
    }
}
----

If there is a relationship between the `Movie` and an `Actor` type, you can also sort when fetching the `actors` field:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies {
        title
        runtime
        actors(sort: [
                {
                    surname: ASC
                }
            ]
        ) {
            surname
        }
    }
}
----

[CAUTION]
====
You can only sort query results based on relationship properties when using the connection API.
