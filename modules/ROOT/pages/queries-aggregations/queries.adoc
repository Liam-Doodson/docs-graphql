:description: This page describes how to read or fetch values in the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

== Type definitions

Quries on this page assume the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post @node {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN, properties: "PostedAt")
    createdAt: DateTime!
}

type User @node {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String!
    age: Int!
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT, properties: "PostedAt")
    friends: [User!]! @relationship(type: "FRIENDS_WITH", direction: OUT)
}

type PostedAt @relationshipProperties {
    date: DateTime
}
----

For which the following query fields are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    posts(where: PostWhere, options: PostOptions): [Post!]!
    postsAggregate(where: PostWhere): PostAggregationSelection!

    users(where: UserWhere, options: UserOptions): [User!]!
    usersAggregate(where: UserWhere): UserAggregationSelection!
}
----

== Writing queries

Based on the type definitions, here are two examples of how to write queries for reading or retrieving values:

.Return all User nodes from their ID and name
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        name
    }
}
----

.Query User with name "Jane Smith" and their posts
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { name_EQ: "Jane Smith" }) {
        id
        name
        posts {
            content
        }
    }
}
----
