:description: This section describes queries and aggregations. 

Each node defined in type definitions has two query fields generated for it: one for *querying* data and another one for *aggregating* it.
Each of these fields, by their part, accepts two arguments used for *filtering*, *sorting*, and *pagination*.

This section addresses the following topics:

* xref:queries-aggregations/queries.adoc[Queries] - Read or fetch values.
* xref:queries-aggregations/aggregations.adoc[Aggregations] - Combine lists of types from different sources into a single list.
* xref:queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc[Filtering] - Filter query results to find objects.
* xref:queries-aggregations/sorting.adoc[Sorting] - Sort query results by individual fields.
* xref:queries-aggregations/pagination/index.adoc[Pagination] - Navigate result pages.
