[[type-definitions-plural]]
== `@plural`

This directive redefines how to compose the plural of the type for the generated operations.
This is particularly useful for types that are not correctly pluralized or are non-English words.
Take this type definition as an example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Tech @plural(value: "Techs") {
  name: String
}
----

This way, instead of the wrongly generated `teches`, the type is properly written as `techs`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
{
  techs {
    title
  }
}
----

The same is applied to other operations such as `createTechs`. 
However, keep in mind that database labels are not changed with this directive.
