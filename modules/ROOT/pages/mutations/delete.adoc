:description: This page describes how to delete nodes using mutations.


= `delete`

Consider these type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
}

type User {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}
----

The following `delete` mutations and response types are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type DeleteInfo {
    nodesDeleted: Int!
    relationshipsDeleted: Int!
}

type Mutation {
    deletePosts(where: PostWhere, delete: PostDeleteInput): DeleteInfo!
    deleteUsers(where: UserWhere, delete: UserDeleteInput): DeleteInfo!
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The `DeleteInfo` type is the common return type for all delete mutations.
====

== Single `delete`

You can delete a single post by executing the following GraphQL statement:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
    deletePosts(where: {
        id: "6042E807-47AE-4857-B7FE-1AADF522DE8B"
    }) {
        nodesDeleted
        relationshipsDeleted
    }
}
----

This deletes the post using the autogenerated ID that was returned after the creation of the post.
Consequently, `nodesDeleted` is equal to `1` (the post) and `relationshipsDeleted` is also equal to `1` as the `HAS_POST` relationship between the `Post` and its author was deleted.

== Nested `delete`

In case you want to delete a `User` and all of their posts, you can use a single nested `delete` mutation:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
mutation {
  deleteUsers(where: { name: "Jane Doe" }, delete: { posts: {} }) {
    nodesDeleted
    relationshipsDeleted
  }
}
